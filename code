async function fetchEmoji() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.emojidex.com/rand");
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.code;
}
This function uses the fetch() function to make a request to the Emoji API and await the response. Then it parses the response as JSON using response.json(). Finally, it returns a random emoji code from the API response.

Note that this function is an async function, which means it returns a Promise that resolves with the emoji code. To use this function, you can call it like this:

fetchEmoji().then(emojiCode => {
  console.log(`Random emoji code: ${emojiCode}`);
});
